************************ Test strategy *********************

PRIME NUMBER :- The number which is divisible by 1 and itself it is called prime number.

==> First find how to check the number is prime or not.

==> First find the test cases for the prime number. 

==> Write a isPrime() in that first the condition to check wheter the input is equal to zero
    --> if one then it is not a prime number, and then check whether number is not negative.(negative number never be prime number).



************************ Test Cases ***********************



(i) If the input is 0 and 1 then output is false.

(ii) If input is negative then output is false.

(iii) If input is that which will be divided by only itself and 1 then it is a prime number then it is not a prime number.
