******************** Test Strategy *********************


==> Write a function findSquartRoot() in that check the condition for negative number or for zero.

==> Find the squart roor of number using squrt() in cmath library.

==> In main function written the code inside the try block to catch any exception is occurring or not at the time of running the program.


******************** Test cases **********************


(1) input = abc
    output = cant use this (as we need integer as a input)

(2) input = -1
    output = cant use this number (as Negative number don't have a real square root.)

(3) input = 0
    output = cant use this number (as 0 number don't have a square root.)       

(4) input = 4
    output = 2
